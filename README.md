# hello-world
Hello everybody !
Development is my new passion !
Discovering the joys of development, my goal is to find a web firm in order to integrate O'Clock school and work part time.
I've already learned HTML5 and CSS3 and created my first responsive website (not online for the moment) by myself ; even thought I think I'm still a newbe ans want to learn more and more.
